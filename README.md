# Design-Pattern-Cafe
## This Program shows how design patterns may be used in a program to encourage the open-close principle of Object Oriented Programming.
### Observer Pattern is used to notify Kitchen and host when an order is placed
### Strategy Pattern allows the user to change the cooking method for different items on the menu 
### Decorator Pattern allows the user to add toppings to their order, and could also be adjusted to allow sides to be ordered as well 
### Factory Pattern can produce order objects without overwriting other objects
